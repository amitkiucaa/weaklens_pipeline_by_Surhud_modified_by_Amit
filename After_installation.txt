Now you know that your weaklens_pipeline is ready to use.
You need to chagne two files



weaklens_select.py
Readme.config                          #or you can create a copy of Readme.config and use that, However I recommend not to make dummy file of weaklens_select.py but you may.






In weaklens_select.py

You need to give info of your lenses ie Ra,Dec,Z,wt

So load your file contating this info for lenses and return this info as arrays.
There are alraedy many such sections written for available  lenses, you add your lens info also in the file.
This info need to be gine in subsections under lens_select() 

Nothing else you have to change in this file.











In Readme.config

I have created a similar file to Readme.config, wtih name  "redmapper_satellites.config". You compare these two files and understand, what you need to do.






after doing this:
 you are ready to run the pipeline by typing command like below.

python weaklens_aroundsource.py --config configfile

Now you know that your weaklens_pipeline is ready to use.


You need to chagne two files

weaklens_select.py
Readme.config                          #or you can create a copy of Readme.config and use that, However I recommend not to make dummy file of weaklens_select.py but you may.



In weaklens_select.py

You need to give info of your lenses ie Ra,Dec,Z,wt

So load your file contating this info for lenses and return this info as array.
There are alraedy many such inbuilt lenses written, you add your lens info also in the file.

Nothing else you have to change in this file.





In Readme.config

I have made a similar file to Readme.confit that is redmapper_satellites.config. You compare these two files and see. What you need to do.






after doing this:
 you are ready to run the pipeline by typing command like below.

python weaklens_aroundsource.py --config configfile

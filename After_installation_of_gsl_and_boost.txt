You have to setup the weaklens pipeline

your python compiler need gsl and boost written for handling c++ files for this weaklens_pipeline installlation.(For gsl and boost intallation see : how_to_install_gsl_boost.txt

We need to set cpp flags for path of gsl and boost location(first you need to install these libraries then give path)


step1: CPPFLAGS="-I/mnt/home/student/camit/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/gsl_installation/include/ -I/mnt/home/student/camit/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/install_boost/include"  LDFLAGS="-L/mnt/csoft/compilers/mpich-3.3.1/lib64 -L/mnt/csoft/compilers/gcc-8.2.0/lib64 -L/mnt/csoft/tools/anaconda3/lib -L/mnt/csoft/tools/anaconda3/lib64 -L/mnt/home/student/camit/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/gsl_installation/lib -L/mnt/home/student/camit/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages -L/mnt/home/student/camit/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/install_boost/include -L/mnt/home/student/camit/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/install_boost/lib"  python setup.py install

The above commad setup cppflags for path of gsl and boost libraries along with seeting ldflags for searching for the libraries for python packages you need for installation. As you will see below multiple paths separated by colon(:) are given to LD_LIBRARY_PATH, for python compiler to search for  diffrent packages 

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/mnt/csoft/compilers/mpich-3.3.1/lib64:/mnt/csoft/compilers/gcc-8.2.0/lib64:/mnt/csoft/tools/anaconda3/lib:/mnt/csoft/tools/anaconda3/lib64:/mnt/home/student/camit/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/gsl_installation/lib:/mnt/home/student/camit/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/install_boost/include:/mnt/home/student/camit/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/install_boost/lib:/mnt/home/student/camit/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages

(put this LD_LIBRARY_PATH  in your ~/.bashrc file)

If step1 complete without any error, that means your pipeline is now set up and ready for usage.







Now you know that your weaklens_pipeline is ready to use.
You need to chagne two files



weaklens_select.py
Readme.config                          #or you can create a copy of Readme.config and use that, However I recommend not to make dummy file of weaklens_select.py                                           but you may.






In weaklens_select.py

You need to give info of your lenses ie Ra,Dec,Z,wt

So load your file contating this info for lenses and return this info as arrays.
There are alraedy many such sections written for available  lenses, you add your lens info also in the file.
This info need to be given in subsections under lens_select() 

Nothing else you have to change in this file.











In Readme.config( help for setting up this file is given in README.md)

I have created a similar file to Readme.config, wtih name  "redmapper_satellites.config". You compare these two files and understand, what you need to do.






after doing this:
you are ready to run the pipeline by typing command like below.

python weaklens_aroundsource.py --config configfile

First you need to set up the wealens_pipeline, its like installing some software for usage.
You may need to follow the following steps.i(Remember pipeline is written for python2, If you want to see how to install a package for particular version of python( I am assuming you may have installed diffrent versions of pythons simultenously) required to run pipeline the "commands_needed_to_setup_pipeline.txt" might be helpful to you"





Run following commands:

Step1: pip install --user -r requirements.txt

Step2: sudo python2 setup.py install

Step3 : python weaklens_aroundsource.py --config configfile

Probably you will encounter many errors while executing above commands(specificaly Step2). Those are because of lack of required libraries. Most of ommands to install those libraries are in "commands*.txt".I would advise you to look at "commands*.txt" before trying other methods.

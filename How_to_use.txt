First you need to set up the wealens_pipeline, its like installing some software for usage.

You may need to follow the following steps. Remember the pipeline is written for python2, so it will need some of the packages installed in python2.7 in libraries, If you want to see how to install a package for particular version of python(am assuming you may have installed diffrent versions of pythons simultenously), required to run pipeline, you will find   "commands_needed_to_setup_pipeline.txt"  helpful.





Run following commands:




Step1: pip install --user -r requirements.txt

Step2: sudo python2 setup.py install   # Read lines written after step3

Step3 : python weaklens_aroundsource.py --config configfile    



Probably you will encounter many errors while executing above commands(specificaly Step2). Those are because of lack of required libraries installed  needed for smooth execution of setup.py.Most of the commands needed  to install those libraries are in "commands_needed_to_setup_pipeline.txt". I would advise you to have a glimpse of the commands in  this file  before heading towards something else.

Note: Step1 & 2 need to be done once. Then everytime for signal computation you just need to execute only step3.

For step3 to get executed properly you need to have "DataStore/S16A_v2.0" folder and its content in your local(or give the path to it for this info), besides files having RA,Dec,Z,wt info for lenses.
